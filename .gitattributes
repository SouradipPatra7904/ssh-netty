# Treat generated files as binary or exclude them from diffs/stats
# Maven's target directory is typically ignored in .gitignore,
# but if any generated files need specific handling, define them here.
# For example, if you include compiled classes for some reason:
# *.class binary

# Mark specific files as binary if they are truly binary and not meant for diffing
# For example, if you store images or other non-text assets in your repo
# *.png binary
# *.jpg binary
